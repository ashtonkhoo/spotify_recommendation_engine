# Project Title
Spotify Recommendation Engine

# Problem Statement
This project analyzes my personal listening habits and musical preference, using Spotify data. Based on this, I want to build a recommendation engine that would suggest new songs based on the audio features available in the dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset is a zip file of multiple json files, each containing data from songs that I have listened to since 2017 (up until 2022, which is the date of data extraction). The dataset was retrieved via the web portal data request (https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/), while the audio features were retrieved via the Spotipy API.
